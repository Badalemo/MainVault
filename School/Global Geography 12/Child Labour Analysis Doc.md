**C - Child labor in the underwater gold industry in the Philippines: HDI - 116 - Medium**

**[The Children Risking Their Lives In Underwater Gold Mines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1L_pxYZVwE) (23 min. Philippines; only place in the world where compression mining is conducted; north eastern coast) [Philippines | History, Map, Flag, Population, Capital, & Facts | Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/place/Philippines)**

1. **What is the daily average wage in this industry?**
    1. Average is about ten dollars, ranging from $6 to $10 to $15
2. **Since compression mining is illegal, why does it still occur?**
    1. Poverty
3. **What types of dangers exist in this industry?**
    1. Drowning, Bombings, lung disease from breathing through tubes for an elongated period of time
4. **How is mercury related to the term ‘dirty gold’?**
    1. Mercury helps bind the tiny specs of gold together, Marcos from the video describes it as glue or magnets for the gold
    2. Mercury is also another danger that exists in the industry, since people are exposed to it for long amounts of time
    3. People and their families are also exposed to the fumes of mercury, when it is burned

**D - [Blood Cobalt: The Congo's Dangerous and Deadly Green Energy Mines | Foreign Correspondent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V3bIzNX4co) 33:00**

**The Democratic Republic of Congo (70% of the world’s cobalt comes from the DRC) HDI - 146 - Low**

1. **Why is the country so poor with such a valuable resource?**
    1. They are being exploited for their resources by chinese owned mining organizations. Very much like Modern day colonization
    2. Water is used to make brine, which is then put into a series of filtering and processing to make lithium carbonate, then battery grade lithium
    3. pumping too much of brine can cause fresh water contamination

**E - [The True Cost of Lithium Mining | True Cost | Insider News](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl0E-UhKB5E) ‘White Gold’, Bolivia, 15:00**

White Gold is salt

1. **How is water an issue in this process?**
    1. before, cattle rearing was one form of income, but because of drought, the job market became practically extinct
    2. brine is made by evaporating salt water, which is then processed into lithium carbonate, and that is also then processed into “battery grade lithium”
    3. In Chile the water is left to evaporate and leaves behind brine

**What are four or five commonalities in the case studies?**

- Absence of P.P.E
- Poverty
- dangerous conditions
- missed years of education
- Necessary for the family income
- Male children are the ones common in all the case studies

**The ‘big’ questions:**

1. **Why are children employed in jobs that are dangerous (4 reasons)?**
    1. small size
    2. They are more expendable
    3. More vulnerable to being threatened
    4. They are healthier than most adults who have been exposed to certain chemicals or diseases
2. **Why are governments reluctant to acknowledge child labour?**
    1. It reflects poorly on them; it affects their reputation
    2. pride
3. **How does child labour increase poverty? (2 ways)**
    1. No education for children
4. **If labour laws exist, why do governments not enforce them?**
    1. Corruption
    2. they need to pay inspectors to go around
    3. There is no alternative for citizens
5. **How can education break the cycle of poverty and child labour in any country?**
    1. Opportunities for higher paying jobs and more variety of jobs
    2. Opportunities for leaving family or home
    3. Less likely to die in dangerous jobs
    4. adults tend to prioritize education
    5. less likely to develop physical and/or intellectual disabilities
6. **If countries, such as the ones focused on in this analysis, had well-funded social safety net programs, do you think child labour would be as common? Why/why not?**
    1. it would not be as common, because everyone would have at least something, there are SSNPs like medicare and free education that help child labour not to be as common.
7. **Investigating, tracking, and eradicating child labour is an important part of the ILO’s mandate/job. Why do you think child labour continues to exist globally even though the ILO is part of the U.N. with 186 member states?**
    1. there is still some sort of colonialism. We see that it China mining cobalt from DRC without community permission, and many European organizations still farming cocoa illegally(through child labour) in Ghana and ivory coast
8. What are two ways child labour perpetuates poverty?
    1. Leads to early deaths and/or lifelong health issues
    2. lack of education means that there would still be poverty
    3. pay is never enough to survive on
    4. children take jobs away from adults, since they can be paid less and are expendable
