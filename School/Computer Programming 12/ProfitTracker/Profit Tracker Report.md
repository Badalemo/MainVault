Using the top to bottom method, i collapsed the challenge into smaller parts:
1. I created an instance of profit tracker,  so that the lists wont get confused
2. I then called a method to ask the user for the weekly goal that would be compared to after every daily input.
3. The next method I called was to get the users daily profit input using the scanner method.
4. I then called a method to display the user's total profit of the week(this is after the user has input his daily profit and type "-1" to break out of the loop)
