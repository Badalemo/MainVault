Using the top-to-bottom method, i collapsed the challenge into smaller parts:
1. I created an instance of profit tracker, so that the lists will not get confused (i.e. the class will have its own independent set of data, which prevents the lists from interfering with each other)
	- Going more in-depth for this tracker explanation: where there is more than one class, changes made in one scenario would affect all the others, which would lead to errors and other unwanted results.
2. I then called a method to ask the user for the weekly goal that would be compared to after every daily input.
3. The next method I called was to get the user's daily profit input using the scanner method.
4. I then called a method to display the user's total profit of the week (this is after the user has input his daily profit and type "-1" to break out of the loop)
5.
