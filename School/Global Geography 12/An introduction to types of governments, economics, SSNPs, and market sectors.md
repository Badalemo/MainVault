[[Gov and economies text and questions]]

1. Define/describe the following types of economies; Traditional, Market, and Command as well as two benefits and two problems associated with each(page 269 and onwards in your text, the table of advantages and disadvantages for Market and Command is on 273). A table will be useful for this question. Why is there no pure market economy?
    
    |Type|Definition|Benefits|Problems|
    |---|---|---|---|
    |Traditional economy|An economy in which people live in relatively small rural communities; produce most of their food, shelter, and clothing; and pass on the knowledge of production techniques from one generation to the next.|It is a self-sufficient economy  <br>  <br>Cheaper organic food|Lack of education to some degree  <br>  <br>Less overall national revenue  <br>  <br>They don’t adapt to the world|
    |Market Economy|The market economy is mainly driven by the laws of supply and demand that operate in the “free market” system. Producers are in business to make a profit, and consumers insist on low prices and high quality in the goods they purchase|There is more overall national revenue  <br>  <br>higher percentage of educated individuals in the population  <br>  <br>Consumers can influence what goods and services are produced.  <br>  <br>A wide variety of goods and services is available.  <br>  <br>There are incentives to use resources efficiently.  <br>  <br>The economy is flexible.  <br>  <br>Competition helps raise quality and lower the price.  <br>  <br>Rewards provide the incentive to improve productivity.|Less healthy food, in the sense that producers want to increase shelf life rather than promote actual food quality  <br>  <br>creation of social classes  <br>  <br>Consumers may be manipulated by advertising.  <br>  <br>If resources are located in areas that are difficult to reach, this reduces the efficient use of the resources.  <br>  <br>Prices do not reflect social costs and benefits.  <br>  <br>The economy experiences trade cycles.  <br>  <br>Restrictive trade practices distort the price mechanism.  <br>  <br>Income is unevenly distributed.|
    |Command economy|A command economy is found in a country where the central government uses its power to determine production patterns.  <br>  <br>The government is the sole decision-maker and economic planner.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>Central Gov’t Determines  <br>-What is made  <br>-how it’s made  <br>-who makes it  <br>-where it’s sold  <br>  <br>The command economy is not communist, it just has to do with government intervention.|High overall national revenue  <br>  <br>Better planned and controlled economy  <br>  <br>Planning encourages high rates of economic growth.  <br>  <br>Planning helps reduce the wastage of resources.  <br>  <br>The distribution of income is more equal.  <br>  <br>Essential goods are produced before less essential goods.  <br>  <br>Planned economies do not suffer from trade cycles|More chance of government corruption  <br>  <br>community is left out since they cannot truly privately own resources/businesses  <br>  <br>Planned economies are bureaucratic and inflexible  <br>  <br>There is little incentive for efficient management.  <br>  <br>The system stifles individual effort.  <br>  <br>Freedom of choice is restricted.  <br>  <br>The quantity, quality , and variety of goods are limited.|
    
    - There is no pure market economy because in every country there is some level of direct government intervention.
2. Explain how Canada has a mixed economy(PG, 276 - 277)
    1. Capitalist principles such as privately owned businesses, the motive for profit, and the ability for businesses to compete in the free market are there. However, the government does not hesitate to intervene in the economy whenever consumers require some form of protection or when competitors face unfair conditions.

  

Some of these interventions can be:

- government subsidies for farmers and fishers,
- wage and price controls, - water is subsidies, and price controls mostly come along with age control
- ownership of Crown corporations, such as the CBC and Canada Post,
- quality-control legislation
- tariff regulations.

1. What are 4 examples of positive government intervention in the economy? (pg. 277)
    1. government subsidies for farmers and fishers,
    2. wage and price controls
    3. ownership of Crown corporations, such as the CBC and Canada Post
    4. quality-control legislation
    5. tariff regulations
2. Define: primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors and resource extractions (pg. 282 - 283) ,
    
    |   |   |
    |---|---|
    |Primary Sector|This includes the farming, fishing, logging, and mining industries - all the industries, in other words, whose products come directly from the natural environment.|
    |Secondary Sector|In the secondary sector these raw materials obtained from the primary sector, are transformed by physical labor, mechanical energy, and technology into finished products. just like iron ore is converted into steel|
    |Tertiary Sector|The tertiary sector is otherwise known as the service sector, it exists to market and maintain the manufactured goods that have been made available to the public.|
    |Sector example: Books|**Primary Sector** - loggers fell trees (extraction)  <br>  <br>**Secondary Sector** - pulp-and-paper company turns the felled trees into paper (processing)  <br>  <br>**Tertiary Sector** - The publishing company converts the paper into a printed book that consumers will buy and read (Finishing)|
    |Resource extractions|Resource extraction is otherwise known as the **Primary Sector**|
    
3. Why are advanced economies more likely to have a larger service sector? (pg. 282)
    - **Increased Industrial Efficiency** – As technology improves, manufacturing becomes more automated, requiring fewer workers. This shifts employment toward service-based industries.
    - **Higher Incomes and Consumer Demand** – With a wealthier population, there is greater demand for services such as education, healthcare, entertainment, and financial services.
    - **Globalization and Outsourcing** – Many manufacturing jobs are outsourced to countries with lower labor costs, leaving advanced economies to focus on high-value services.
    - **Knowledge-Based Economy** – Advanced economies rely more on knowledge-intensive jobs such as IT, research, finance, and consulting, which fall under the service sector.
    - Subsidized Programs
    - Specialized education
    - More people, buildings etc.
4. How is a traditional economy related to the primary sector?
    1. both a traditional economy and the primary sector depend on natural resources for survival and economic activities
        
        - in a traditional economy, people rely on farming, fishing, hunting, and gathering activities that fall under the primary sector.
        - Production methods are based on customs and traditions, often passed down through generations, without modern technology or large-scale industrialization.
        - The economy is usually self-sufficient, with minimal trade or dependence on secondary (manufacturing) or tertiary (service) sectors
        
        Essentially, a traditional economy is heavily dependent on primary sector activities to meet the basic needs of food, shelter, and clothing.
        
5. What are GNP and GDP? (pg. 284)
    1. **GNP** - (Gross National Product (To measure a country’s wealth.)) is the total of the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - GNP = GDP + net income on foreign investments
    2. **GDP** - (Gross Domestic Product) income earned from all domestic goods and services.
6. Why do some consider GNP/GDP misleading and what do they prefer to use? (pg. 285)
    1. Some say that this method ignores the pockets of terrible poverty that exist in some MDCs(More Developed Countries), such as in the inner cores of many large American cities, and the pockets of affluence that exist in many LDCs(Less Developed Countries)
    2. They also say money should not be the sole criterion of a nation’s well-being; social factors such as education levels, life expectancy, gender equality, and freedom from persecution also apply.
    3. They prefer to use **HDI** - i.e. LLDCs(Least Developed Countries), LDCs (Less Developed Countries), and, MDCs (More Developed Countries) as the more complete system of measuring a country’s standard of living.t
7. What is the definition of capital resources and provide 3 examples? (pg. 213)
    
    ||**Definition**|**Examples**|
    |---|---|---|
    |Capital Resources|Capital resources can be defined as resources a society uses to further the creation of wealth.  <br>  <br>- Increases wealth in a country|Machinery - mechanization  <br>Factories  <br>Established Currency(Printed Money)  <br>buildings  <br>equipment|
    
8. What is the definition of human resources and what 3 characteristics do they require? (pg.214…) What is the least important and why?
    
    ||Definition|Characteristics|
    |---|---|---|
    |Human Resources|Human resources are the people who live in a nation. They play a significant role in determining its strength  <br>  <br>They have to be  <br>- Healthy  <br>HealthCare has to be Affordable, and accessible for everyone(all over the country)  <br>- Educated  <br>Affordable, accessible for everyone(all over the country)  <br>- Sufficient numbers of people who are healthy and educated|They have to exist in sufficient numbers to form both a pool of labor and a domestic market for the goods and services the country produces  <br>  <br>They have to enjoy a level of health that enables them to work productively and raise their families  <br>  <br>They have to be given the opportunity for education and training, which will enable them to become productive members of society|
    
    The first characteristic is the least important because a very large population can be a drawback if it exceeds a sustainable level.

The degree of government intervention can go from **Laissez-faire** (Little to no government intervention in economic affairs) to the other extreme **Big Brother**(Extreme government interference/intervention in all aspects of society; Economy & society)  
  
  
Democracy: a form of government in which the people/citizens hold political power and can rule either directly or through elected representatives. What are three advantages of a democratic system?

- The leader is chosen by the people
- Everyone has the opportunity can get into power

What is economics? The study of the wealth and resources of a country or region, especially in terms of the production and consumption of goods and services.

  

Infrastructure refers to everything required to move goods and services (people) around a region such as; rail, roads, bridges, ports, airports as well as communications systems, water and sewer pipes, treatment plants, and power systems.

  

‘the west and the rest’ refers to:
