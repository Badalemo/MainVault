1. **What is Ozone? (Pg. 48)**
    1. Ozone is gas that protects human life on Earth by filtering out excessive ultraviolet (UV) radiation. High doses of this form of radiation can be lethal to human beings because they cause skin cancer and weaken the immune system. UV radiation is also harmful to nearly all plant life, the first and most important link in the food chain.
2. **What is an ecosystem? (Pg. 48)**
    1. Ecosystems are well-defined habitats hosting systems of interacting organisms.
3. **What is a food chain and a food web? (Pg. 71)**
    1. Each time one organism eats another, energy is transferred from the eaten to the eater. All energy begins with the sun and is transferred to plant, herbivore, carnivore, and so on. This transfer of energy is called **food chain**
    2. of course, in most ecosystems like the pond mentioned earlier, there are many different food chains and many of them overlap This is because some different types of animals share certain food sources but not others. Therefore, the many different food chains in the pond have to be linked together in different ways if we want to show all the food relationships in this one small ecosystem. Rather than a chain, the trophic pattern will end up looking like a web. For this reason, the energy relationship; in most ecosystems is more correctly called a **food web**.
4. **What are 5 effects of deforestation? (Pg. 116)**
    1. More surface runoff
    2. decline in plants and animal species
    3. increased the risk of flooding and landslides or mudslides
    4. Soil erosion
    5. Loss of Biodiversity
    6. increased risk of wildfires
5. **What are two ways deforestation is related to global warming?** (Pg 118)
    1. Decay and burning of the wood releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere;
    2. Second, the ability of the former forest to remove carbon dioxide from the air is also lost.
6. **What is the definition of desertification? (Pg 120)**
    1. Desertification is the process by which a productive Dryland area is degraded to where it becomes unproductive desert land.
    2. it means desert land that becomes infertile
7. What are the four causes of desertification and their definitions (if you do not know them)? P. 120
    1. Over-cultivation
    2. Overgrazing
    3. deforestation
    4. inappropriate irrigation techniques
8. **What causes soil to lose its ability to absorb rain (impervious)? P. 121**
    1. With the plant life gone, the soil loses its moisture more quickly and becomes more vulnerable to erosion. As the soil dries out, it presses together, or compacts. When this happens, the soil becomes **impervious.**
9. **How can irrigation be harmful? P. 121**
    1. On irrigated land, the soil may become sterile or lifeless because the repeated irrigation causes a buildup of salts to such a level that plants can no longer survive. Then the same cycle of events follows.
10. **What are 5 effects of desertification? P. 120-2**
    1. Weather changes by raising temperatures and lowering humidity levels
    2. Reduced vegetation cover and declining soil quality add to greenhouse gas emissions
    3. Once the plants are gone, biodiversity suffers as the insects, birds, and mammals that depended on those plants for food and shelter also disappear.
    4. Wood shortages
    5. As more and more land changes to infertile desert, the people who live there are forced to seek new places to grow their food.
